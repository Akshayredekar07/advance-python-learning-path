    "## **Regular Expressions**\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to represent a group of strings according to a particular format/pattern, then we should use **Regular Expressions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular Expressions (Regex) provide a declarative mechanism to represent a group of strings according to a particular format or pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Examples:**\n",
    "1. Writing a regular expression to represent all mobile numbers.\n",
    "2. Writing a regular expression to represent all email IDs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Applications of Regular Expressions:**\n",
    "1. **Validation Frameworks/Logic:** Used to develop validation rules for inputs.\n",
    "2. **Pattern Matching Applications:** Examples include `Ctrl+F` in Windows or `grep` in UNIX.\n",
    "3. **Translators:** Useful in developing compilers, interpreters, etc.\n",
    "4. **Digital Circuits:** Used for designing circuits based on specific patterns.\n",
    "5. **Communication Protocols:** Helps in creating protocols like TCP/IP, UDP, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Using Regular Expressions in Python:**\n",
    "We can develop regular expression-based applications in Python using the `re` module. This module provides several inbuilt functions that make working with regular expressions easier in Python applications.\n"
