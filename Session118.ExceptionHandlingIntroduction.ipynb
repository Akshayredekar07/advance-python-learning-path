    "## Types of Errors in Python Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "In any programming language, there are two types of errors possible:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Syntax Errors**\n",
    "2. **Runtime Errors**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Syntax Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax errors occur due to invalid syntax in the program. These errors prevent the program from executing and must be corrected by the programmer.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 1:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 10\n",
    "if x == 10\n",
    "    print(\"Hello\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Error:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "SyntaxError: invalid syntax\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 2:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print \"Hello\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Error:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "SyntaxError: Missing parentheses in call to 'print'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note:\n",
    "The programmer is responsible for correcting syntax errors. Program execution will not start until all syntax errors are resolved.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Runtime Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "Runtime errors, also known as exceptions, occur during the execution of the program. They are caused by issues such as invalid user input, logical errors, or memory-related problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Division by zero:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   print(10 / 0)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   **Error:**\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   ZeroDivisionError: division by zero\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Invalid operand types:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   print(10 / \"ten\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   **Error:**\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for /: 'int' and 'str'\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Invalid input conversion:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   x = int(input(\"Enter Number: \"))\n",
    "   print(x)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   **Input:**\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   Enter Number: ten\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   **Error:**\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'ten'\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note:\n",
    "The **exception handling** concept is applicable for runtime errors but not for syntax errors.\n"

    "## What is an Exception?\n",
    "\n",
    "An **exception** is an unwanted and unexpected event that disturbs the normal flow of a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples of Exceptions:\n",
    "- `ZeroDivisionError`\n",
    "- `TypeError`\n",
    "- `ValueError`\n",
    "- `FileNotFoundError`\n",
    "- `EOFError`\n",
    "- `SleepingError`\n",
    "- `TyrePuncturedError`\n",
    "\n",
    "It is highly recommended to handle exceptions. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose of Exception Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "The main objective of exception handling is **graceful termination** of the program. This means:\n",
    "- Resources should not be blocked.\n",
    "- Important tasks should not be missed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Meaning of Exception Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "Exception handling does not mean **repairing** the exception. Instead, it involves defining an alternative way to allow the program to continue running normally.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, if the program is required to read data from a remote file located in London, but at runtime, the file is unavailable, the program should not terminate abnormally. Instead, we should provide an alternative (e.g., a local file) to continue the program normally.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Code Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # Attempt to read data from a remote file located in London\n",
    "    read_data_from_remote_file()\n",
    "except FileNotFoundError:\n",
    "    # Use a local file as an alternative\n",
    "    use_local_file()\n",
    "```\n",

    "## Default Exception Handling in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "- Every exception in Python is an **object**. For every exception type, corresponding classes are available.\n",
    "- Whenever an exception occurs, the **Python Virtual Machine (PVM)** creates the corresponding exception object and checks for handling code. \n",
    "- If handling code is not available, the Python interpreter terminates the program abnormally and prints the corresponding exception information to the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The rest of the program will **not** be executed after an unhandled exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(\"Hello\")\n",
    "print(10 / 0)\n",
