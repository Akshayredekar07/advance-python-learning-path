    "In Python, thread synchronization is essential when multiple threads access shared resources concurrently. Without proper synchronization, issues like race conditions and data inconsistencies can occur. Python's `threading` module provides several synchronization primitives to manage access to shared resources effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Synchronization Mechanisms in Python:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Lock:**\n",
    "   - A `Lock` is the most basic synchronization primitive. It allows only one thread to access a shared resource at a time. A thread acquires the lock before accessing the resource and releases it afterward.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import threading\n",
    "\n",
    "   lock = threading.Lock()\n",
    "\n",
    "   def critical_section():\n",
    "       with lock:\n",
    "           # Access shared resource\n",
    "           pass\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **RLock (Reentrant Lock):**\n",
    "   - An `RLock` allows a thread to acquire the same lock multiple times without causing a deadlock. This is useful in recursive functions or when a thread needs to re-enter a critical section.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import threading\n",
    "\n",
    "   rlock = threading.RLock()\n",
    "\n",
    "   def recursive_function():\n",
    "       with rlock:\n",
    "           # Perform recursive operations\n",
    "           recursive_function()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Semaphore:**\n",
    "   - A `Semaphore` controls access to a resource that has a limited capacity. It maintains an internal counter, decrementing it when a thread acquires the semaphore and incrementing it when released. When the counter reaches zero, any subsequent acquire calls will block until another thread releases the semaphore.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import threading\n",
    "\n",
    "   semaphore = threading.Semaphore(value=5)  # Allows up to 5 threads\n",
    "\n",
    "   def access_limited_resource():\n",
    "       with semaphore:\n",
    "           # Access the limited resource\n",
    "           pass\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Event:**\n",
    "   - An `Event` is a simple synchronization primitive that allows one thread to signal one or more other threads that a particular event has occurred. Threads can wait for the event to be set before proceeding.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import threading\n",
    "\n",
    "   event = threading.Event()\n",
    "\n",
    "   def wait_for_event():\n",
    "       event.wait()  # Block until the event is set\n",
    "       # Proceed after the event is set\n",
    "\n",
    "   def trigger_event():\n",
    "       # Perform some operations\n",
    "       event.set()  # Signal the event\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Condition:**\n",
    "   - A `Condition` variable allows threads to wait for certain conditions to be met. It is often used in conjunction with a lock to synchronize access to shared resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import threading\n",
    "\n",
    "   condition = threading.Condition()\n",
    "\n",
    "   def consumer():\n",
    "       with condition:\n",
    "           condition.wait()  # Wait for the condition to be notified\n",
    "           # Access the shared resource\n",
    "\n",
    "   def producer():\n",
    "       with condition:\n",
    "           # Update the shared resource\n",
    "           condition.notify()  # Notify the waiting threads\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best Practices:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Minimize Lock Scope:** Keep the critical section (the code between acquiring and releasing the lock) as short as possible to reduce contention between threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Avoid Deadlocks:** Be cautious when acquiring multiple locks. Always acquire them in a consistent order to prevent circular dependencies that can lead to deadlocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use High-Level Constructs:** When appropriate, use higher-level synchronization constructs like `Queue` from the `queue` module, which handles synchronization internally, simplifying thread-safe operations.\n"

    "#### Synchronization Using Semaphore\n",
    "\n",
    "- In `Lock` and `RLock`, only one thread can access at a time.\n",
    "- `Semaphore` allows a specific number of threads to access a shared resource simultaneously (e.g., 10 users accessing a database or 4 using a network connection).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Characteristics of Semaphore:\n",
    "- Limits access to shared resources with finite capacity.\n",
    "- Advanced synchronization mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Creation:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from threading import Semaphore\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create Semaphore with a specific counter value\n",
    "s = Semaphore(counter)\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **`counter`**: Maximum threads allowed simultaneously. Default is `1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Behavior:\n",
    "- **`acquire()`**: Decreases the counter by 1.\n",
    "- **`release()`**: Increases the counter by 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Scenarios:\n",
    "1. **`Semaphore()`**:\n",
    "   - Counter = 1.\n",
    "   - Equivalent to the `Lock` concept, allowing only one thread at a time.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **`Semaphore(3)`**:\n",
    "   - Counter = 3.\n",
    "   - Allows up to 3 threads to access simultaneously. Others must wait until the semaphore is released.\n",
