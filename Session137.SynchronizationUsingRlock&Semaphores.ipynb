    "#### Synchronization Using Semaphore\n",
    "\n",
    "- In `Lock` and `RLock`, only one thread can access at a time.\n",
    "- `Semaphore` allows a specific number of threads to access a shared resource simultaneously (e.g., 10 users accessing a database or 4 using a network connection).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Characteristics of Semaphore:\n",
    "- Limits access to shared resources with finite capacity.\n",
    "- Advanced synchronization mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Creation:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from threading import Semaphore\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create Semaphore with a specific counter value\n",
    "s = Semaphore(counter)\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **`counter`**: Maximum threads allowed simultaneously. Default is `1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Behavior:\n",
    "- **`acquire()`**: Decreases the counter by 1.\n",
    "- **`release()`**: Increases the counter by 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Scenarios:\n",
    "1. **`Semaphore()`**:\n",
    "   - Counter = 1.\n",
    "   - Equivalent to the `Lock` concept, allowing only one thread at a time.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **`Semaphore(3)`**:\n",
    "   - Counter = 3.\n",
    "   - Allows up to 3 threads to access simultaneously. Others must wait until the semaphore is released.\n",
