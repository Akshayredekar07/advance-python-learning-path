```bash
jupyter notebook
```

## How to Use This Repository

### For Beginners
1. Start with the `language_basics` folder to understand Python fundamentals
2. Progress through `data_types` to learn about built-in data structures
3. Continue with `functions`, `modules`, and `packages`
4. Move to `oop_basics` for an introduction to object-oriented programming

### For Intermediate Learners
1. Explore `inheritance` and `advanced_oop` to deepen OOP knowledge
2. Study `exception_handling` and `file_handling` for I/O operations
3. Dive into `multithreading` for concurrent programming concepts
4. Work through `decorators`, `generators`, and `regex` modules

### For Advanced Users
1. Focus on `database` for data persistence techniques
2. Explore `serialization` for object serialization strategies
3. Study `logging` for application monitoring
4. Complete `mini_projects` to apply knowledge to real problems
5. Practice with `interview_questions` for skill reinforcement
