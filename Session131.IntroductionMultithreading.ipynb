    "#### **Example:**\n",
    "- While typing a Python program in the editor, we can listen to MP3 audio songs from the same system.  \n",
    "- At the same time, we can download a file from the internet.  \n",
    "- All these tasks are executing simultaneously and are independent of each other.  \n",
