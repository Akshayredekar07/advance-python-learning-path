    "### **Daemon Threads in Python**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Daemon Threads** are threads that run in the background. Their main purpose is to provide support for non-daemon threads (like the main thread).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Daemon threads terminate automatically** when all non-daemon threads finish execution.\n",
    "- **Non-daemon threads** are essential for the program and continue running until they complete execution.\n",
    "- Common use cases: Background tasks such as logging, monitoring, or garbage collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Checking Daemon Status\n",
    "In Python 3.10 and later, the `isDaemon()` method is deprecated. Use the `daemon` property instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from threading import current_thread\n",
    "\n",
    "# Check if the current thread is a daemon thread\n",
    "print(current_thread().daemon)  # Output: False\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Setting Daemon Status\n",
    "To set a thread as a daemon, use the `daemon` property before starting the thread.  \n",
    "**Note**: Once a thread has started, you cannot change its daemon status.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from threading import Thread\n",
    "\n",
    "def worker():\n",
    "    print(\"Child thread is running\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a thread\n",
    "t = Thread(target=worker)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Set the thread as daemon\n",
    "t.daemon = True\n",
    "print(t.daemon)  # Output: True\n",
    "\n",
    "# Start the thread\n",
    "t.start()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Attempting to Change Daemon Status After Starting:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from threading import Thread\n",
    "\n",
    "t = Thread(target=lambda: print(\"Hello\"))\n",
    "t.start()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Attempting to change daemon status after starting raises an error\n",
    "t.daemon = True  # Raises RuntimeError: cannot set daemon status of active thread\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Default Daemon Nature\n",
    "1. **Main Thread**: Always non-daemon and cannot have its status changed.\n",
    "2. **Child Threads**: Inherit daemon status from their parent thread:\n",
    "   - If the parent thread is non-daemon, the child thread is non-daemon.\n",
    "   - If the parent thread is daemon, the child thread is also daemon.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from threading import Thread\n",
    "\n",
    "def worker():\n",
    "    print(\"Child thread running\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a child thread\n",
    "t = Thread(target=worker)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Default daemon status is inherited from the parent (main thread)\n",
    "print(t.daemon)  # Output: False\n",
    "\n",
    "# Set the child thread as daemon\n",
    "t.daemon = True\n",
    "print(t.daemon)  # Output: True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Daemon Thread Termination\n",
    "When the last non-daemon thread terminates, all daemon threads are automatically terminated, even if they are still executing.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from threading import Thread\n",
    "import time\n",
    "\n",
    "def worker():\n",
    "    for i in range(10):\n",
    "        print(\"Lazy thread\")\n",
    "        time.sleep(2)\n",
    "\n",
    "t = Thread(target=worker)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Uncomment to make the thread a daemon\n",
    "# t.daemon = True\n",
    "\n",
    "t.start()\n",
    "time.sleep(5)\n",
    "print(\"End of main thread\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **If the child thread is non-daemon**:\n",
    "  The program will wait for the child thread to finish.\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  Lazy thread\n",
    "  Lazy thread\n",
    "  Lazy thread\n",
    "  End of main thread\n",
    "  Lazy thread\n",
    "  ...\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **If the child thread is daemon**:\n",
    "  The child thread will terminate when the main thread finishes.\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  Lazy thread\n",
    "  Lazy thread\n",
    "  Lazy thread\n",
    "  End of main thread\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary\n",
    "1. Use `daemon` property to check or set daemon status.\n",
    "2. Always set daemon status **before starting the thread**.\n",
    "3. The main thread is always non-daemon and cannot be changed.\n",
    "4. Daemon threads terminate automatically when all non-daemon threads finish.\n"
