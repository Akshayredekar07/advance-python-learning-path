    "## **Types of Exceptions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, there are two types of exceptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Predefined Exceptions**\n",
    "2. **User Defined Exceptions**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1 Predefined Exceptions:**\n",
    "- Also known as **inbuilt exceptions**.\n",
    "- These exceptions are raised automatically by the Python virtual machine whenever a particular event occurs.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Example 1: Zero Division Error**\n",
    "When trying to perform division by zero, Python raises a `ZeroDivisionError` automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(10/0)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 2: Value Error**\n",
    "When trying to convert a non-numeric string to an integer, Python raises a `ValueError`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = int(\"ten\")  # Raises ValueError\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2 User Defined Exceptions:**\n",
    "- Also known as **Customized Exceptions** or **Programmatic Exceptions**.\n",
    "- Sometimes, we need to define and raise exceptions explicitly to indicate that something went wrong. These types of exceptions are known as **User Defined Exceptions**.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- The programmer is responsible for defining these exceptions. Python does not have any built-in knowledge about these exceptions, so they need to be raised explicitly using the `raise` keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Examples of Custom Exceptions:**\n",
    "- `InSufficientFundsException`\n",
    "- `InvalidInputException`\n",
    "- `TooYoungException`\n",
    "- `TooOldException`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How to Define and Raise Customized Exceptions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Every exception in Python is a class that extends the `Exception` class either directly or indirectly.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class ClassName(PredefinedExceptionClass):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, arg):\n",
    "        self.msg = arg\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: Defining Custom Exceptions**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class TooYoungException(Exception):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, arg):\n",
    "        self.msg = arg\n",
    "\n",
    "class TooOldException(Exception):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, arg):\n",
    "        self.msg = arg\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Raising Custom Exceptions:**\n",
    "We can raise the exceptions using the `raise` keyword as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "raise TooYoungException(\"Plz wait some more time, you will get best match soon!!!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example Program Using Custom Exceptions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class TooYoungException(Exception):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, arg):\n",
    "        self.msg = arg\n",
    "\n",
    "class TooOldException(Exception):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, arg):\n",
    "        self.msg = arg\n",
    "\n",
    "age = int(input(\"Enter Age:\"))\n",
    "if age > 60:\n",
    "    raise TooYoungException(\"Plz wait some more time, you will get best match soon!!!\")\n",
    "elif age < 18:\n",
    "    raise TooOldException(\"Your age already crossed marriage age...no chance of getting married\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"You will get match details soon by email!!!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Sample Output:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **If Age is 90**:\n",
    "    ```plaintext\n",
    "    __main__.TooYoungException: Plz wait some more time, you will get best match soon!!!\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **If Age is 12**:\n",
    "    ```plaintext\n",
    "    __main__.TooOldException: Your age already crossed marriage age...no chance of getting married\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **If Age is 27**:\n",
    "    ```plaintext\n",
    "    You will get match details soon by email!!!\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:**  \n",
    "The `raise` keyword is best suited for customized exceptions but not for predefined exceptions.\n",
