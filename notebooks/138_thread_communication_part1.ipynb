    "### **Inter Thread Communication**\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, as part of programming requirements, threads are required to communicate with each other. This concept is known as **interthread communication**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**  \n",
    "After producing items, the Producer thread has to communicate with the Consumer thread to notify it about new items. Then the Consumer thread can consume those new items.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, we can implement interthread communication using the following mechanisms:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Event**  \n",
    "2. **Condition**  \n",
    "3. **Queue**  \n",
    "   etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Interthread Communication Using Event Objects**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Event object** is the simplest communication mechanism between threads. One thread signals an event, and other threads wait for it.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We can create an Event object as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "event = threading.Event()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The Event object manages an **internal flag** that can be set or cleared. Threads can wait until the event is set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Methods of the Event Class**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`set()`**  \n",
    "   - Sets the internal flag to `True`.  \n",
    "   - Represents a **GREEN** signal for all waiting threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`clear()`**  \n",
    "   - Sets the internal flag to `False`.  \n",
    "   - Represents a **RED** signal for all waiting threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`is_set()`**  \n",
    "   - Checks whether the event is set or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **`wait()` | `wait(seconds)`**  \n",
    "   - Causes a thread to wait until the event is set.  \n",
    "   - Optionally, the thread can wait for a specified number of seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Pseudo Code for Event-Based Communication**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "event = threading.Event()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Consumer thread has to wait until the event is set\n",
    "event.wait()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Producer thread can set or clear the event\n",
    "event.set()\n",
    "event.clear()\n",
    "```\n"
