    "### **Interthread Communication Using Condition Object**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Condition` object in Python provides a more advanced mechanism for interthread communication compared to the `Event` object. It represents a state change in the application (e.g., producing or consuming an item). Threads can wait for a specific condition and get notified once that condition occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A `Condition` object allows one or more threads to wait until notified by another thread.\n",
    "- The `Condition` object is always associated with a lock (usually a `ReentrantLock`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Features**\n",
    "1. The `Condition` object has methods like `acquire()` and `release()` that internally call the corresponding methods of the associated lock.\n",
    "2. It provides additional methods like `wait()`, `notify()`, and `notifyAll()` for interthread communication.\n",
