    "### **FILE HANDLING**\n",
    "\n",
    "- As the part of programming requirement, we have to store our data permanently for future purpose. For this requirement we should go for files.\n",
    "- Files are very common permanent storage areas to store our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Types of Files:**\n",
    "There are 2 types of files:\n",
    "1) **Text Files**:  \n",
    "   Usually we can use text files to store character data.  \n",
    "   Eg: abc.txt\n",
    "\n",
    "2) **Binary Files**:  \n",
    "   Usually we can use binary files to store binary data like images, video files, audio files etc...\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Opening a File:**\n",
    "- Before performing any operation (like read or write) on the file, first we have to open that file. For this we should use Python's inbuilt function `open()`.\n",
    "- But at the time of open, we have to specify mode, which represents the purpose of opening file.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "f = open(filename, mode)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**_The allowed modes in Python are:_**\n",
    "\n",
    "1) **r** → open an existing file for read operation. The file pointer is positioned at the beginning of the file. If the specified file does not exist then we will get `FileNotFoundError`. This is default mode.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2) **w** → open an existing file for write operation. If the file already contains some data then it will be overridden. If the specified file is not already available then this mode will create that file.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3) **a** → open an existing file for append operation. It won't override existing data. If the specified file is not already available then this mode will create a new file.\n",
    "   \n",
    "4) **r+** → To read and write data into the file. The previous data in the file will not be deleted. The file pointer is placed at the beginning of the file.\n",
    "   \n",
    "5) **w+** → To write and read data. It will override existing data.\n",
    "   \n",
    "6) **a+** → To append and read data from the file. It won't override existing data.\n",
    "   \n",
    "7) **x** → To open a file in exclusive creation mode for write operation. If the file already exists then we will get `FileExistsError`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q1. In which of the following modes a new file will be created?**\n",
    "w, a, a+, x\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q2. In which of the following modes file should be available already?**\n",
    "r, r+\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q3. In which of the following modes file should not be available already?**\n",
    "x\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q4. In which of the following modes overwriting of existing data will be happened?**\n",
    "w, w+, r+\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: All the above modes are applicable for text files. If the above modes are suffixed with 'b' then these represent binary files.\n",
    "Eg: `rb`, `wb`, `ab`, `r+b`, `w+b`, `a+b`, `xb`\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "f = open(\"abc.txt\", \"w\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "We are opening `abc.txt` file for writing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Closing a File:**\n",
    "After completing our operations on the file, it is highly recommended to close the file. For this we have to use `close()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "f.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Various Properties of File Object:**\n",
    "Once we opened a file and we got file object, we can get various details related to that file by using its properties:\n",
    "- `name` → Name of opened file\n",
    "- `mode` → Mode in which the file is opened\n",
    "- `closed` → Returns boolean value indicating whether the file is closed or not\n",
    "- `readable()` → Returns boolean value indicating whether file is readable or not\n",
    "- `writable()` → Returns boolean value indicating whether file is writable or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "f = open(\"abc.txt\", 'w')\n",
    "print(\"File Name: \", f.name)\n",
    "print(\"File Mode: \", f.mode)\n",
    "print(\"Is File Readable: \", f.readable())\n",
    "print(\"Is File Writable: \", f.writable())\n",
    "print(\"Is File Closed: \", f.closed)\n",
    "f.close()\n",
    "print(\"Is File Closed: \", f.closed)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "```text\n",
    "File Name: abc.txt\n",
    "File Mode: w\n",
    "Is File Readable: False\n",
    "Is File Writable: True\n",
    "Is File Closed: False\n",
    "Is File Closed: True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Writing Data to Text Files:**\n",
    "We can write character data to the text files by using the following 2 methods:\n",
    "1) `write(str)`\n",
    "2) `writelines(list of lines)`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "f = open(\"abcd.txt\", 'w')\n",
    "f.write(\"Durga\\n\")\n",
    "f.write(\"Software\\n\")\n",
    "f.write(\"Solutions\\n\")\n",
    "print(\"Data written to the file successfully\")\n",
    "f.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`abcd.txt`:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Durga\n",
    "Software\n",
    "Solutions\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** In the above program, data present in the file will be overridden every time if we run the program. Instead of overriding, if we want an append operation, then we should open the file as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "f = open(\"abcd.txt\", \"a\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 2:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "f = open(\"abcd.txt\", 'w')\n",
    "list = [\"surya\\n\", \"bunny\\n\", \"vinny\\n\", \"chinny\"]\n",
    "f.writelines(list)\n",
    "print(\"List of lines written to the file successfully\")\n",
    "f.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`abcd.txt`:\n",
    "```\n",
    "surya\n",
    "bunny\n",
    "vinny\n",
    "chinny\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** While writing data by using `write()` methods, we must provide a line separator (`\\n`), otherwise all the data will be written to a single line.\n"
